# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code that is reusable code and only works when acalled or invoked.

  Researched answer:  Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. When called.



2. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:  When using console.log() only the developer can see this but return, function will tap out once the condition is met.

  Researched answer: The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have use a variable value. the console. log(); is a function (you can see the brackets) that will write the argument value on the console. And only the debuging console, in a browser you will not see anything on the screen.

   console.log() is only used when debugging 
   return is used for returning values from a function



3. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is the place holder for the function where an argument in usually what the user inputs.

  Researched answer: A parameters define the method signature. Arguments are values passed into a function.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:A  built-in methods are methodes that are ready for us to use that come with javascript.

  Researched answer: JavaScript has several "top-level" built-in functions. JavaScript also has four built-in objects: Array, Date, Math, and String. Each object has special-purpose properties and methods associated with it. JavaScript also has constructors for Boolean and Number types.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The main reason why to pair programme is so one person can drive and the other can tell the driver "where to go". The benefits of pair programming are the ability to communicate effectively and find slutions to problems form more than one person.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Even though the subejct can be hard to learn as it is a lot to take in, the breaks help a lot and the ice-breakers excrcieses were very helpful because I was able to relax and get ready to take in more information.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: In simple words, A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output. For example, Array. prototype. map , Array. prototype.

2. Jest: Jest is a universal testing platform, with the ability to adapt to any JavaScript library or framework

3. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

4. Constructor: The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class.

5. React:React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is used to build single page applications. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
